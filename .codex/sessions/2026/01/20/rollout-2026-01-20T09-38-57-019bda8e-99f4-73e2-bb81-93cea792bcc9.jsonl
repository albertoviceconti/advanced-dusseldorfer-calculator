Network access is restricted. Approvals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. `approval_policy` is `on-request`: Commands will be run in the sandbox by default, and you can specify in your tool call if you want to escalate a command to run without sandboxing. If the completing the task requires escalated permissions, Do not let these settings or the sandbox deter you from attempting to accomplish the user's task.\r\n\r\nHere are scenarios where you'll need to request approval:\r\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\r\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\r\n- You are running sandboxed and need to run a command that requires network access (e.g. installing packages)\r\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with approval. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\r\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\r\n\r\nWhen requesting approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\r\n  - Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\r\n  - Include a short, 1 sentence explanation for why you need escalated permissions in the justification parameter</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/alber/Dokumente/GitHub/advanced-dusseldorfer-calculator/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/alber/Dokumente/GitHub/advanced-dusseldorfer-calculator/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Deploy/demo if ready\r\n\r\n### Incremental Delivery\r\n\r\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational â†’ Foundation ready\r\n2. Add User Story 1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\r\n3. Add User Story 2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo\r\n4. Add User Story 3 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo\r\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\r\n\r\n### Parallel Team Strategy\r\n\r\nWith multiple developers:\r\n\r\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\r\n2. Once Foundational is done:\r\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\r\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\r\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\r\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\r\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\r\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\r\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\r\n- Commit after each task or logical group\r\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\r\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\r\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/alber/Dokumente/GitHub/advanced-dusseldorfer-calculator/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/alber/Dokumente/GitHub/advanced-dusseldorfer-calculator/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/alber/Dokumente/GitHub/advanced-dusseldorfer-calculator/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/alber/Dokumente/GitHub/advanced-dusseldorfer-calculator/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Every output MUST surface the table year, income group, age\n+bracket, and each adjustment step used. Any change to calculation rules MUST\n+cite the official source and update the rule mapping.\n+\n+### Local, Dependency-Light Execution\n+All calculation logic MUST execute locally within the Blazor application with\n+no external service calls. External dependencies (packages, services, or APIs)\n+are prohibited unless explicitly approved in Governance with a documented need.\n+\n+### Privacy by Default\n+Personal data MUST stay in memory by default and MUST NOT be logged or shared.\n+Persistence or export of data MUST be opt-in and initiated by the user with\n+clear confirmation. Provide a clear reset path that wipes in-session data.\n+\n+### Explainable Results\n+The UI MUST present a readable calculation breakdown, including inputs,\n+intermediate steps, and final results. Validation errors MUST identify the\n+field, rule, and expected range or format.\n+\n+### Robust Input Modeling\n+The system MUST support multiple parents, multiple children, and relevant income\n+types and deductions. Inputs MUST be validated for ranges and consistency, and\n+defaults MUST be explicit and visible to the user before calculation.\n+\n+## Product Scope and Constraints\n+This is a Blazor web application for calculating child support amounts based on\n+the Dusseldorfer Tabelle. The app MUST function without external network calls\n+for core calculations and MUST not require third-party services. The primary\n+delivery target is a responsive web UI for desktop and mobile browsers.\n+\n+## Development Workflow and Quality Gates\n+Changes to calculation rules MUST include an updated table source reference and\n+at least one verification step (test or documented manual check). UI changes\n+MUST preserve the explainability breakdown and validation clarity. All changes\n+MUST include a constitution compliance check before merge.\n+\n+## Governance\n+This constitution supersedes local conventions and templates. Amendments require\n+documentation of the change, rationale, and any migration notes.

Inputs MUST be validated for ranges and consistency, and\n+defaults MUST be explicit and visible to the user before calculation.\n+\n+## Product Scope and Constraints\n+This is a Blazor web application for calculating child support amounts based on\n+the Dusseldorfer Tabelle. The app MUST function without external network calls\n+for core calculations and MUST not require third-party services. The primary\n+delivery target is a responsive web UI for desktop and mobile browsers.\n+\n+## Development Workflow and Quality Gates\n+Changes to calculation rules MUST include an updated table source reference and\n+at least one verification step (test or documented manual check). UI changes\n+MUST preserve the explainability breakdown and validation clarity. All changes\n+MUST include a constitution compliance check before merge.\n+\n+## Governance\n+This constitution supersedes local conventions and templates.
